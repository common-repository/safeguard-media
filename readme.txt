Secure copy protection for images, video and PDF. Prevent screenshots, screen capture and screen recording.

== Description ==

This plugin adds an iFrame to copy protect and watermark Images, MP4 video, PDF and Word documents on WordPress pages.  

Unlike other plugins that can do no more than hamper the use of right-click, this solution is the real deal... it uses the ArtistScope Site Protection System (ASPS) to prevent screenshots, screen capture and screen recording. ASPS normally requires a dedicated server, but by using this plugin, any WordPress site can utilise real content protection, even from a shared hosting server.

* Easy install (use the Classic Editor or Elementor or Gutenberg editor).
* Copy protect images, video and PDF displayed on your web pages.
* Copy protect GIF, JPG, PNG, MP4, PDF and Word documents.
* Prevent sreenshots, screen capture and screen recording.
* HTML is encrypted from server to secure browser.
* View source for media locations is not possible.
* Locating media via packet sniffers is not possible.
* Word documents are converted to PDF on the server.
* Embeds objects dynamically using JavaScript.
* Settings can control user access per platform.
* Most secure protection from ALL avenues of copy and save.
* Watermark options for position, size, colour and transparency.
* Media can be hosted on your site or a third party file service.
* Can be viewed on Windows, Mac, iOS and Android phones.
